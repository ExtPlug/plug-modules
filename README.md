# plug-modules

Maps plug.dj defined modules to reasonable names, so you can more easily
access internal plug.dj javascript.

## Warning!

`plug-modules` makes it easy to use plug.dj's client-side internals.
Remember that plug.dj's internal JavaScript is *not* meant to be a
public API. It changes a lot! Modules that you used yesterday, may not
exist tomorrow, so make sure to code very defensively and to fall back
gracefully.

## Usage

`plug-modules` is available on npm:
```
$ npm install plug-modules
```

This is useful for dependency management and updates, but `plug-modules`
does *not* currently work in a Node/io.js environment, and does *not*
export anything through browserify-able means, either. You might want a
build step to actually literally include the
[`plug-modules.js`](./plug-modules.js) file for now, until that mess is
fixed.

After applying this script in the browser, you can access plug.dj
odules like:

```javascript
var SubClass = plugModules.require('plug/core/Class').extend({
  /* class definition */
});

plugModules.require('plug/core/Events')
  .trigger('notify', 'icon-plug-dj', 'Notification text');
```

Or make yourself an admin locally: (Fun fact! This will make plug.dj
log some more debug info to the console :smile: )

```javascript
var currentUser = plugModules.require('plug/models/currentUser');
currentUser.set('gRole', 5);
```

`plugModules.require()` modules in your browser's developer console or
use [replug](https://github.com/PlugLynn/replug) to figure out what the
different modules are for, and what you can do with/to them.

## API

### plugModules.require(modulename)

Returns a plug.dj module. You can use any of the remapped module names,
as well as original (obfuscated) names.

### plugModules.register()

Defines all the remapped names on the global `require()` object, so you
can use `require()` to access modules via the remapped names, too.

### plugModules.isDefined(modulename)

Checks if a module with the given name has been defined. Accepts both
remapped and original module names. Note that a module that actually
equals `undefined` also returns `false`:

```javascript
define('module', function () { return undefined })
plugModules.isDefined('module') === false
```

### plugModules.getUnknownModules()

Returns an array of **original** module names that were *not* remapped.
This is mostly useful for reverse-engineering more modules.

## How It Works

`plug-modules` contains several hundred "Detectives" who find different
modules by duck-typing. They then associate those modules with a
descriptive and readable name each. You can call
`plugModules.register()` to inject all those names back into require.js,
so you can use the global `require()` function on plug.dj.
Alternatively, you can use `plugModules.require()` if you don't want to
contaminate the global module-space.
